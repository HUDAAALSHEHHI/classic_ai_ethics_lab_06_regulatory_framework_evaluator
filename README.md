🧠 Comprehensive Experiment Explanation

This experiment focuses on assessing and enhancing regulatory frameworks for integrating AI in scientific research. The model examines institutional datasets to detect missing compliance elements, ethical inconsistencies, or high-risk policies. By applying automated auditing through data-driven analysis, the experiment demonstrates how artificial intelligence can reinforce institutional governance and ethical research conduct.

✏️ Objective

To develop a predictive compliance evaluation system capable of identifying governance weaknesses, classifying ethical risk levels, and providing actionable recommendations for research institutions to strengthen their regulatory policies.

📘 Results

The model successfully detected inconsistencies in compliance and flagged potential governance risks. Automated analysis improved transparency and reduced oversight latency, demonstrating that AI-driven regulatory evaluation can enhance decision-making and ensure continuous policy improvement.

📗 Observations

Integrating AI into governance auditing establishes a system of proactive accountability, where institutions evolve from reactive policy enforcement to anticipatory ethical management.
The experiment confirms that well-designed regulatory intelligence not only safeguards integrity but also builds trust, compliance, and long-term sustainability in AI-enabled scientific ecosystems.
